### find each patient's last encounter date/latest discharge date (date-365)
### find the date 1 year before that date.
### choose encounter IDs that happened after that 1-year mark.
### sum the charges for those encounter IDs. 
# I guess that  if you had no encounters in the previous year, the cost value is the intercept.

#For each patient, identify which encounters happened after the last discharge
#add encounter dates to the charges_all table
#create new charges all data that includes encounter dates, the summarises 2 only charges whose associated date was before the cutoff
# Note that in doing this, we will lose some patients. We will have to tack them back on to charges all, giving them having 0 charges
